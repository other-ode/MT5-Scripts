# FVG in Forex Trading

## What is FVG?

**FVG** stands for **Fair Value Gap**. In forex trading, a Fair Value Gap refers to a price imbalance or inefficiency on a price chart, typically observed on candlestick charts. It represents a zone where price has moved so rapidly that there was little to no trading activity, often leaving a "gap" between candles.

## How is FVG Identified?

An FVG is commonly seen after a strong impulsive move in the market. It is identified by looking at three consecutive candles:

- **Bullish FVG:** When the low of the first candle is higher than the high of the third candle.
- **Bearish FVG:** When the high of the first candle is lower than the low of the third candle.

This leaves a gap between the first and third candle, indicating a price area where buyers or sellers did not have an opportunity to trade.

## Why is FVG Important?

Traders use FVGs to:

- Spot price imbalances that may be filled later (price revisiting the gap area).
- Identify potential support and resistance zones.
- Build trading strategies around mean reversion or continuation.

## How Do Traders Use FVGs?

1. **Entry and Exit Points:** Some traders wait for price to revisit the FVG area before entering trades, expecting the gap to act as support or resistance.
2. **Confirmation:** FVGs can be used to confirm the strength of a trend or as part of a confluence with other indicators.
3. **Setting Targets:** FVG zones often become targets for taking profit or placing stop losses.

## Example

Suppose you observe the following candle sequence:

```
Candle 1: Low = 1.1000, High = 1.1050
Candle 2: Low = 1.1055, High = 1.1100
Candle 3: Low = 1.1110, High = 1.1150
```

If the low of Candle 1 (1.1000) is higher than the high of Candle 3 (1.1150), a bullish FVG is present between these points.

## Cautions

- Not all FVGs will result in price reversal or continuation.
- It is recommended to use FVGs with other technical analysis tools.
- Market context and timeframes matterâ€”FVGs are more significant on higher timeframes.
